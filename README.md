# 💡 Todo

Todo is a simple yet powerful task management system based on `gRPC` technology. It provides a client-server architecture for efficient communication and remote procedure calls.

The Todo system allows users to `create`, `update`, and `delete` tasks, as well as view a list of their tasks. Each task can contain a title, description, due date and status

Todo provides reliable and secure data transfer using data transfer protocols such as `HTTP/2` and `Protobuf`. This makes the system fast, efficient and reliable even when processing large volumes of tasks.

With Todo, you can easily organize your to-dos, manage tasks, and streamline your workflow. It is ideal for individual use or team collaboration. Thanks to its flexible architecture and simple interface, Todo allows you to quickly and efficiently organize your life and achieve your goals.
